# PEP-8

## Context

[PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) is the standard style guide for Python. Code is read more often than written and thus should be easy to read. Adhering to PEP-8 makes your code more consistent and easier for others to collaborate on.

## Objective

This exercise is meant to get you familiar with identifying and writing PEP-8 compliant code.

There is a module in the 01_pep8 package called name_generator.py. This file is not currently PEP-8 compliant. Your job is to correct all the PEP-8 compliancy issues and create a Pull Request with the fixed code.
